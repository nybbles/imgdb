I started this project to learn about web development and about Common Lisp. It
is basically a very lame Flickr clone. It uses the Hunchentoot framework for
the backend and plain HTML with some CSS, Javascript, Dojo and AJAX calls for
the frontend. I have not touched this code in more than 2 years and I have
already cringed at the little bits of code I've seen tonight.

There is some stuff I'm proud of though, like the cache for image resizing.

From what I can remember, the server runs on OS X and Linux and requires the
imagemagick libraries and a postgres database server. The cache for image
resizing uses the postgres server to do concurrency stuff - it's pretty sweet,
IMO. It's here, if you care:
http://github.com/nybbles/imgdb/tree/code-cleanup/imgdb-store.

In retrospect, and given all the exciting new developments in both web frontend
and backend, I probably wouldn't build a website like this. But it was fun at
the time.
